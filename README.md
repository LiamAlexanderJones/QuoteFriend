# QuoteFriend
A simple app that downloads fancy-sounding quotes from an API and presents them to the user in a swipeable format. The user can swipe left to delete a quote and prevent it from reappearing, or right to save it. Demonstrates use of SwiftUI with gestures, networking, Core Data, Combine, and unit tests.
